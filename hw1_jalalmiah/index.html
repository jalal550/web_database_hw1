        Most of the services we enjoy on the Web are provided by web database applications. Web-based email, online shopping, forums and bulletin boards,
        corporate web sites, and sports and news portals are all database-driven. To build a modern web site, you need to develop a database application.
        The most popular database management system used in these solutions is MySQL, a very fast and easy-to-use system distributed under an Open Source 
        license by its manufacturer, MySQL AB.With a web server such as Apache (we assume Apache in this book, although the software discussed here works 
        with other web servers as well) and MySQL, you have most of what you need to develop a web database application. The key glue you need is a way for
        the web server to talk to the database; in other words, a way to incorporate database operations into web pages. The most popular glue that accomplishes
        this task is PHP.PHP is an open source project of the Apache Software Foundation and itâ€™s the most popular Apache web server add-on module, with around 
        53% of the Apache HTTP servers having PHP capabilities.[1] PHP is particularly suited to web database applications because of its integration tools for 
        the Web and database environments. In particular, the flexibility of embedding scripts in HTML pages permits easy integration of HTML presentation and code.
        The database tier integration support is also excellent, with more than 15 libraries available to interact with almost all popular database servers. In 
        this book, we present a comprehensive view of PHP along with a number of powerful extensions provided by a repository known as PEAR.<br><br>
